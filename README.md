# About
This repository contains all my public work. It may include code, but other data and files could also be part of it. Mostly you'll find tinier programs here. According to plan, I'll create a new repository for bigger projects.

# Please notice
Please notice that I am a newbie to development. That means: My code won't be efficient and may contain issues. If you have suggestions regarding this, please let me know. :)
